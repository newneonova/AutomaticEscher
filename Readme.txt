EscherMapFunctionsV3.py is python code written in the summer of 2015. It is designed to take as input a COBRA file describing the metabolic model of an organism and output a escher map, or a series of escher maps depicting parts of the metabolic pathways.  This is supposed to output the obvious map connections to allow manual map makers to have some pre made maps to start with. It also outputs some statistics about the sub-paths based on the catagory.
